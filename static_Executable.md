how to create a static app(exe) under widows without installation
Creating a static app (an executable file) that runs on Windows without requiring installation involves a few steps. Here's a general guide:

Choose a Programming Language: Select a language like C++, Python, or C#. Each has tools to create standalone executables.

Static Linking: If you're using C++ or similar, ensure all libraries are statically linked. For example, with GCC, you can use the -static flag during compilation.

Python to EXE: If you're using Python, tools like pyinstaller or cx_Freeze can bundle your script and dependencies into a single executable. Use the --onefile option to create a standalone file.

Avoid Registry and System Dependencies: Design your app to avoid relying on system settings or registry entries. Store configurations locally (e.g., in .ini files).

Test Portability: Run the executable on different systems to ensure it works without additional installations.

Optional Compression: Use tools like UPX to compress the executable for easier distribution.
