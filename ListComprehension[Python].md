# List Comprehension Examples

List comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python. It allows for readable and expressive one-liners that can simplify your code. 
Below are 10 examples illustrating different use cases of list comprehension:

1. Basic list creation using range.
2. Squaring numbers in a range.
3. Filtering even numbers from a range.
4. Multiplying elements of a list.
5. Extracting vowels from a string.
6. Converting strings to lowercase.
7. Nested list comprehension to flatten a matrix.
8. Generating tuples of index and element.
9. Creating a dictionary from keys and values.
10. Performing conditional operations in list comprehension.

# 1. Basic list creation using range
basic_list = [x for x in range(10)]

# 2. Squaring numbers in a range
squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

# 3. Filtering even numbers from a range
even_numbers = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]

# 4. Multiplying elements of a list
multiplied_elements = [x * 2 for x in [1, 2, 3, 4]]

# 5. Extracting vowels from a string
vowels = [char for char in "example sentence" if char in "aeiou"]

# 6. Converting strings to lowercase
lowercase_strings = [s.lower() for s in ["PYTHON", "PROGRAMMING", "IS", "FUN"]]

# 7. Nested list comprehension to flatten a matrix
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
flattened_matrix = [num for row in matrix for num in row]

# 8. Generating tuples of index and element
indexed_items = [(i, x) for i, x in enumerate(["apple", "banana", "cherry"])]

# 9. Creating a dictionary from keys and values
keys = ['a', 'b', 'c']
values = [1, 2, 3]
dictionary = {k: v for k, v in zip(keys, values)}

# 10. Performing conditional operations in list comprehension
conditional_list = [x if x % 2 == 0 else -1 for x in range(10)]
